# Pandit Kaushal — Hero Scaffold

This repo contains a minimal Next.js + Tailwind scaffold with an animated hero (`ChakraHero`) demonstrating rotating chakras, a floating Ganesha asset, and particle effects.

Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm

Setup (Windows PowerShell)
```
cd "c:/Users/SHALINI JHA/OneDrive/Desktop/PANDIT KAUSHAL"
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes
- Fonts (Playfair Display, Inter, Noto Sans Devanagari) are not included. Add via Google Fonts or self-host.
- The animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query.
- This is a UI scaffold only — backend, payments, and full pages are not included.
